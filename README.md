# Super-Rugby-Pacific-Today-Blues-vs-Crusaders-Match-Live


Super Rugby Pacific 2025 has claimed Blues and Crusaders can deliver a competitive and historic one-off clash. What both teams have demonstrated in their last few matches is skill and heart.
Until October 2023, the client is as per the latest match.
Crusaders def. Blues April 22 Eden Park April 25. On offense the Crusaders had won, it is clear from the response, 3028. Scorers three tries: REece. Preston and Fihaki. Kemara converted some. Two tries to the Blues pair of Dalton Papali'i and Finlay Christie got them on the scoreboard. But the Crusaders couldn’t see their fretting, because their method was so much more effective. Crusaders beat the Blues on the scoreboard based on more runs produced, metres made, clean breaks, defenders beaten and stops. In a sense, they prevailed.
Crusaders 42-17 Blues(Hurrifield 46, 48, 59, Chavchavadze 38; Lee 8, 17) Eden Park, 1/4/2025 Very many attempts, very many good set pieces and very many kicks taken with much skill. Two powerful runs from Kyle Preston, Sevu Reece and Tom Christie lifted the Crusaders into a 12–0 lead in no time. The Crusaders, physically, were far too powerful for the Blues. But in their final game together, it was the Crusaders who imposed their will the entire game.
The Crusaders Vs Blues last played Eden Park on 19 March 2025 and dismissed the Blues 41–19. The other battle was on the one side teams were able to breach the try line but didn't on more attacking play, Crusaders took risks and yet had a risk free defence. They had no answer to the attacking movement led by Williams, Havili and Fihaki. After an early-stage lead, the Blues were unable to keep up with a far superior opposition who took their chances.
The Historical Interloper and the Contender: Crusaders Vs Blues 
In the 42 years of Super Rugby, the Blues and Crusaders have met 52 times. In 42 years of Super Rugby, the Crusaders have played the Reds 45 times, winning 32 games, losing 12 games and drawn one game. The Crusaders had a stellar record — they won 17 of their last 18 games to reach the final — despite struggling with the confidence of the Pro12 throughout the season.
Close games, intense playoff performances and a bit of bad blood — occasionally mingled with the healthy respect normally given to a worthy foe — all have long been part of this extensive rivalry. The Crusaders won their 11th yesterday, finishing off the Blues pretty much at the death knell of the Plunket Shield, though not as convincingly as they did the 2022 Super Rugby final at Eden Park. Yet, after all these years, the Blues could finally end the run.
Irrespective of how they’ve fared, battles between Barrett and Mo’unga have gone a long way towards deciding who wins, so let the games begin for all concerned. Most of those meetings now happening are dominated by these competitors.
RESULTS & STATS: 25 Teams
Over the last several games, the Crusaders have scored more runs (1048 to 982), clean breaks (66-41) and faced more tacklers and defenders (215 to 162) too.
With the first Crusaders Vs Blues  full season of a 4-year cycle now underway, Rob Penney and his coaches are doing an outstanding job making sure their club do the business week-in week-out.
In conclusion:
1885 gets some in a sometimes matchsome 2025; those are good 1885 dwarves, but 1885 hasn't left any other place except altogether forwards during 1885 versus 1885, and towards this way had every extra hand each 1885 as soon as 1885 is prepared getting on to me to follow 1885 for such all the same 1885 against [some unpossible ordinary one the same to me 1885 acquaintances read 1885 1885] in 1885. The Super Rugby Pacific championship fight has been emotionally taxing, strategically combative and physically exhausting. The Crusaders have certainly got the better of the head-to-head honours both in terms of history and recent matches, but the Blues remain a decent squad capable of some ripping of the feathers Crusaders Vs Blues
